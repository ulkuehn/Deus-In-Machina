## Export

### What's the concept of exporting in DIM?

One of the ideas of DIM is that you should concentrate on content, not appearance. It is hard enough to write good texts and keep track of all aspects of the elements you are writing about. How this may finally look on a sheet of paper or in a publication should be the least of your worries.

Thus, only when exporting you decide what becomes part of your product -- which texts, which objects and what metadata. Don't expect fancy formatting such as page numbers or footnotes. Your standard word processor or desktop publishing program is a good place to feed the export into to give it the final polish.

### What information can be exported?

Almost always you'll want to export your texts, but you can do more:

- Project metadata like title, author, character or word count
- Text metadata like name, status or word count
- Text content, possibly enhanced with object tags
- Object content and metadata

### How do I determine what's in an export?

The export includes what you put in the editors. You can enter and style regular text. It will be included in the export as is. To insert some project specific information use one of the placeholders from the select box top right of the editor. Be aware that the cursor must be placed in the editor before placeholders can be inserted.

To tailor an export profile use the various editors and options that are provided in the different tabs of the export window:

- _Document_ tab

  In this tab you set the format type and edit what the export includes on a project level. In most cases you need the _exported Texts_ placeholder which is a placeholder for the sequence of all texts as defined in the _Texts_ tab.

  If you want to add object information to your export, also put the _exported Objects_ placeholder somewhere in the document editor.

- _Texts_ tab

  In this tab you select if all texts should be included in the export or only the activated ones. To export the text content, add the _Text Content_ placeholder. Use additional placeholders for meta data.

- _Object markings_ tab

  When exporting texts you can highlight the embedded objects if you wish. For one you can use the object styling in yout texts, much the same as it appears in the editor (with some limitations in RTF export). Additionally, you can enclose each text passage connected to an object with some extra text. You could prepend the object's name, for example and enclose the passage in parantheses.

  Choose what objects you want to highlight -- all objects, the activated objects or none at all. In the latter case the other settings in that tab have no effect.

- _Objects_ tab

  You can add a list of objects in your project if you include the _exported Objects_ placeholder in the editor of the document tab. In this tab you set what objects to include and what is included in the object list for each object.

  You can choose between list style and table style for object content and text quotes. If you use the _Object content as list_ placeholder you must populate the _Object properties_ tab.

- _Object properties_ tab

  This tab is only needed if you include the _Object content as list_ placeholder in the _Objects_ tab. For each property of each object this list is filled with what you set in the editor of this tab.

### What formats can I export to?

There are three formats you can choose:
| Format | Styles | Images | Preview |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Text | none | no | yes |
| HTML | all | yes | yes |
| RTF | most | yes | no |

### Isn't there a way to export to PDF?

No, not with the export function. But you can print the editor's content to a PDF file. Or, first export to RTF or HTML and go to PDF from there using your browser or word processor.

### Can I print texts directly rather than exporting them?

You can print what's visible in the editor. More details in the _Editing_ section.

### Can I reuse the export profiles of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
