## Program settings

### What is the difference between global and project settings?

Global settings are default settings that initially apply to all new projects. They are stored in a central place on your computer.

Project settings are specific to individual projects, overruling the respective global settings. They are stored within project files.

As long as you do not touch a specific project setting the respective global value will be effective in the project. Typically, project settings are used sparsely as you want to tailor the global settings to your best fit in the first place. But of course you can do it any other way.

### Why are there so many individual settings?

DIM is designed to give the user a maximum of flexibility for organizing his or her writing process. While certain features and design options may be welcome by some they could be useless or even annoying for others.

It may take a while to find the best setup individually but in the end you will hopefully find yourself at home in DIM.

### What are Standard categories?

Standard categories are default text categories (such as text status) that are used initially in all new projects. They can be adapted to the project specific needs in the project properties window (menu item _File &rarr; Project properties_).

### Can I reuse the settings of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
