## Paragraph formats

### How are paragraph formats managed?

Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Pragraph formats_ to open the formats window.

### How do I style a format?

Use the controls to change various aspects of the format's style. You can see the effect of each change in the preview box. The sample text used for preview can be changed in the settings.

### How do I apply a format?

In the editor select the format you want to apply to a paragraph (or several paragraphs within a selection). If you change a format's style this immediately effects all paragraphs the format is applied to.

### Can I reuse the formats of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
