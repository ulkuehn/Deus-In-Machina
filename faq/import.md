## Imports

### How do I import a file?

Files can be imported by using menu item _File &rarr; Import &rarr; from file_. Text files, HTML files and RTF files are supported. The textual content of the file will be imported to one DIM text.

### How do I import a folder?

Folders can be imported by using menu item _File &rarr; Import &rarr; from folder_. All Text, HTML and RTF files in that folder will be imported as individual DIM texts. All other files are ignored. In the settings you can control if the folder structure is reflected in the DIM import or if the import is a flat list.

### How do I import a web page?

Use menu item _File &rarr; Import &rarr; from web page_ to open a browser like window. Load the web page by entering its URL or following a link in an already opened page. As soon as the page has fully loaded (might take a while) press the _Import_-Button.

Depending on the website the import might be more or less of what you could see and read in the browser.

If you want to import just parts of a web page, you can select the respective text passage and copy/paste it into a DIM text.

### How do I import an existing project?

Use menu item _File &rarr; Import &rarr; from DIM file_ to open the project you want to import from. Select the

- texts,
- text collections,
- objects,
- paragraph formats,
- correctly spelled words,
- export profiles, and
- settings

you want to import. As text collections, texts, objects and formats are interdependent some of them might be imported automatically.
