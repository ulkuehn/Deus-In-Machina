## Text Collections

### What are text collections anyway?

Text collections are sets of texts that are grouped together. The texts in a collection come in a flat list no matter what their level in the text tree is. They are ordered along the tree sequence, though.
There are two collection types:

- In user defined collections you can add whatever texts you wish (e.g. you could make a collection of all chapter headings or a collection of all texts having a common viewpoint).
- In search collections the set of texts is determined by the search and filter criteria of the collection. Texts are added or removed automatically when text contents or properties change.

### How do I add a text collection?

For a regular collection use menu item _Texts &rarr; New Text Collection_. For a search collection use menu item _Texts &rarr; Search and filter_.

### How do I add a text to a collection?

In a text's context menu you find a submenu _Add to Collection_ with all (non search) collections listed.

### How do I remove a text from a collection?

In a text's context menu you find a submenu _Remove from Collection_ with all collections listed the text is part of.

### How do I delete a text collection?

In a collection's context menu use item _Delete collection_

### How can I view and edit a collection's properties?

Either

- double click on a collection list item, or
- use the _Properties_ item in a collection's context menu.

### How do I adjust a collection's appearance?

You can set the display style (bold etc) in the collection's properties or add an icon that is shown next to the item's name in the collection list.

### How do I change a collection's name?

- Use _Rename_ in the context menu of the respective item in the collection list, or
- Edit the _Name_ field in the collection's properties

### How do I change the criteria of a search collection?

In a search collection's properties you find a _Search and filter_ tab that works the same way as the search and filter function that was used to create the collection.

### When activating a collection, are the texts in the collection activated autmatically?

By default, yes. But you can configure this in the settings.

### How do I copy a text collection?

To copy a collection select the item in the tree, press Ctrl and move the item to a new position in the tree. A copy of the collection will be placed there.

### Can I copy a search collection to a regular one?

Yes. In a collection's context menu use _Copy to non-search Collection_ to create a non-search collection that includes all texts currently covered by the search collection's search/filter criteria.

### Can I reuse the text collections of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
