## Projects

### How can I view and change a project's properties?

Use menu item _File &rarr; Project Properties_ to open the properties window. Several tabs provide general and statistical data about the project. Also, cover information can be inserted.

### What are text categories and how are they set?

Text categories are sets of properties that can be applied to texts. In the project's properties you can define a status set (concerning the maturity or progress of a text), a text type set and a user defined set.

Each text can be assigned one of the values of each category with icons showing these values in the text tree.

Initially the project categories are a copy of the global categories as defined in the settings. You can adjust them to the project's specifics.

### How do I password protect my project?

Enter a password in the project properties window (tab _Project information_). After that the project will be saved encrypted and once closed can only be opened if the password is provided. _Be aware that the project cannot be opened if you don't remember the password. There is no known way to recover a lost password_.

### It is possible to open project files with other programs?

Absolutely. Project files are, in essence, SQLite files that can be handeled by tools like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). For password protected projects you need the version with SQLCipher support.
