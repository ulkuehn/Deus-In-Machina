## General

### What is DIM? Should I use it?

If you ever write more than a shopping list, definitely! DIM is a writing tool intended for small, medium and large writing projects. While it features some well known standards that come with many word processors, DIM has some outstanding qualities:

- It adds a semantic level to texts with tools to build a world of feature rich objects (characters, items, locations, or anything else you might come up with) texts can be connected with.
- It helps to manage large and complex texts and creative projects by splitting them up into chunks (say, chapters or scenes or sections) that can be edited individually or in combination with other text chunks. Those chunks can be moved around quickly to reorganize the overall text.
- Contrary to the concept of WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) with DIM you get what you want. Only when finally putting everything together in exporting your project for use by a more traditional word processor or publishing software you decide what parts are included and what parts are left out. There is no need to consider what the output will finally be early in writing. You can concentrate on content, not worry about form.

### What are the license conditions of DIM?

DIM is Free and Open Software and can be used freely by anyone. It is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#license-text).

### How do I install DIM?

Instructions for installing and building on Windows and Linux are available in the README file.

### Is there a Mac version?

Not for the time being as I don't have access to a Mac based system.

### Is it safe to use?

While DIM most certainly won't set your computer ablaze it still is in an early development phase. There might be errors not yet discovered. So, please save your work frequently and help improving DIM by your feedback.

### Is there a user's manual?

No. For now, the only guidance is this FAQ, some inline help and a couple of sample projects.

### What does "DIM" stand for?

It's short for _Deus In Machina_, Latin for "God in the machine". This term is a pun to the infamous plot device _Deus Ex Machina_ that was common in ancient Greek theater but should be avoided in modern fiction.

### I have a suggestion, run into an error, found a flaw, want to contribute.

You are welcome!

In case of error reporting please provide the logfile that is linked in the tab _Runtime Info_ of the _About Window_ (to open use menu item _Help &rarr; About DIM_). If possible, activate the setting _start in Debug Mode_ which makes logging much more detailed.

### What languages are supported?

Currently, English and German are supported. What language is used depends on your system defaults, but you can change it in the settings.

### Could a French, Spanish, Ukrainian, ... version be provided?

Certainly -- DIM is i18n-ready and, translators volunteering, could be extended to additional languages.
