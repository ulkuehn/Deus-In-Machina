## Object References

### What can I use the reference section for?

The object reference table lists all text passages (quotes) in all texts currently in the editor that are connected with all currently activated objects. It thus gives an overview of the objects you are interested in in the texts you are editing.

### How do I find a specific quote?

You can use the filter input to narrow down the table of quotes to what you are looking for.

### How can I jump to the respective section in the editor?

When you click on a quote in the table the relevant section in the editor is selected.

### What's the order of the references?

References are ordered in their natural sequence, i.e. first come the quotes of the first text in the editor, no matter what object they refer to, next come the quotes of the second text in the editor and so on.

You can reverse the order by clicking on the ordering arrows and the right end of the table header.
