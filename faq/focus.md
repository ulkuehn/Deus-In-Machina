## Editing in Focus Mode

### How do I switch to focus mode?

Focus mode can be opened by menu item _View &rarr; Focus mode_ to display all texts currently in the editor, or in an editor's context menu to display just the single text at hand.

To return from focus mode use the Escape key.

### How can I customize focus mode?

In the settings you can set background images and sound effects. While in focus mode you can adjust the editing width and height and change the sound effects.

### Can I add or remove object tags in focus mode?

No, you cannot change what parts of a text is connected to objects. Please do this in standard mode.

You can change which objects are displayed/highlighted in focus mode, though.

### Is it possible to play additional sounds in focus mode?

No. The sounds are limited to what is provided.
