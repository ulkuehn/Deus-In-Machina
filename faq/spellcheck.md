## Spellchecking

### How do I spellcheck my texts?

There are two ways to check for spelling errors:

- Use the spellcheck button in the status bar of the editor. All words considered wrongly spelled are marked with a red wavy line (as per default; you can change this in the settings).
- Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Spellcheck_ to interactively correct your texts in the editor.

### How do I set the language used for spell checking?

You can change this by using _Editor &rarr; Language_. The language used for spell checking is independent of the language of the user interface. There is no automatic recognition of the language of the texts in the editor.

### In interactive spell checking what is the effect of the different buttons?

There are three buttons you can use for a unknown word:

- _correct_, resulting in replacing the word in the editor by the word in the correction field; you can use one of the suggestions provided by clicking on them or type something by yourself;
- _ignore_, resulting in moving to the next unknown word;
- _always ignore_, resulting in putting the word on the list of correct words and move to the next unknown word; words in the list of correct words will be ignored for spell checking.

### How do I view and edit the list of correct words?

Use _Editor &rarr; List of correct Words_ to open a window where all words are listed and new words can be added. Typically, you want to add uncommon proper names to the list. The list is saved as part of the project, so each project has its own list.

### Can I reuse the list of correct words of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
