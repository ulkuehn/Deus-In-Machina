## Editing and Formatting Texts

### How do I do basic formatting?

Use the buttons in the editor's menu bar or the respective items in the editor's context menu to change the selection to **bold**, _italic_, <u>underline</u> or ~~striketrough~~.

### How do I apply paragraph formats?

Just select the format from the dropdown in the editor's menu bar. It is applied to all paragraphs of the current selection.

### How to search within the displayed texts?

In the editor's menu bar you find a search bar. The search covers all texts currently shown in the editor. If you want to find which texts in your project contain a search phrase, being currently shown in the editor or not, please use menu item _Texts &rarr; Search and Filter_.

### How do I find text and replace it?

The search bar provides a second layer for replacing. Switch between layers by clicking on the looking glass icon.

Replacements can be done one after the other or for all search results at once. Please be aware that a single step replacement cannot be undone.

### How can I zoom the text in the editor?

To zoom in or out you can either use the scroll wheel (or touch bar pinch gesture) or use the zoom slider in the editor's status bar. To reset to standard zoom click on the percentage figure.

### How do I insert characters not available on my keyboard?

Use the button labeled _Special Characters_ in the editor's menu bar to open a window displaying a variety of characters and symbols. You can move the cursor while the window is open and insert as many symbols as needed.

### How do I move (copy) sections between texts in the editor?

Use drag and drop or cut/copy/paste.

### How do I use the web tools?

When text is selected in the editor you can use the web tools at the end of the editor's context menu. You can search for the selected text on the web, translate it, find synonyms or whatever a website might offer.

While there is a standard set of tools provided you can adapt them in the settings to your specific needs. Flexibility is key in complex work processes, and writing for sure is a complex task.

### Can I print what I am seeing?

Yes, and there are two options. Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Print editor contents_ to print the editor's content either to one of your system printers or into a PDF file. What you see is what is printed -- that is, the currently activated texts with those passages highlighted that are connected to the currently activated objects.
