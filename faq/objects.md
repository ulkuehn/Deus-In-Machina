## Objects

### What is the concept behind objects?

Objects represent arbitrary items (characters, places, buildings, devices, animals, weapons, ideas, and anything else you could think of). They are called "objects", but don't take that term too narrow. Objects span dead as well as living matter and even ideas.

Objects can be connected to those sections of a text that are relevant for the object, thus adding a semantical level to the text. If, for example, an object represents a story's main character the sentences or paragraphs giving a physical description of that character could be connected to the object.

Once the relationship between objects and texts is established it is easy to overview the relevant text sections and to highlight them in the editor if needed.

### How do I add an object to the tree?

- Use _New Object above_ or _New Object below_ in the context menu of the respective item in the object tree, or
- Use menu item _Objects &rarr; New object_ to add a new object as the last child of the selected object

### How can I view and edit an object's properties?

Either

- double click on a tree item, or
- use the _Properties_ item in an object's context menu.

### How do I move an object?

Just move the respective tree item to the desired position in the tree and drop it there. To move a whole branch, keep the Shift key pressed.

### How do I copy an object?

To copy an object select the item in the tree, press Ctrl and move the item to a new position in the tree. A copy of the object will be placed there.

While the object copy inherits the properties of the original object as far as possible, the new object is not connected to any text.

### How do I copy an object branch?

To copy a whole branch of the tree select the top item of the branch, press Ctrl and Shift simultaneously and move the item to a new position in the tree. A copy of the branch will be placed there.

### How do I change an object's name?

- Use _Rename_ in the context menu of the respective item in the object tree, or
- Edit the _Name_ field in the object's properties

### How do I adjust an object's appearance in the tree?

You can set the display style (bold etc) in the object's properties or add an icon that is shown next to the item's name in the tree.

### How do I delete an object?

To delete an object

- you can use the _Delete Object_ option in the item's context menu, or
- use menu item _Objects &rarr; Delete Object_. You can select several objects to delete them in one step.

### How do I change an object's format?

The format of an object affects the styling of text passages that are connected to the object, highlighting those passages when an object is activated. You can set the format in the _Style_ tab of an object property window.
    
Formats are inherited along the object hierarchy. If you do not set any format controls for an object it has the same style as its parent. All format settings for an object is affecting its children unless you are overruling them in any of the children individually.

### How do I change the properties of an object?

Double click on an item in the object tree or use item _Properties_ in an object's context menu.

### How do I show an object in the editor?

An object must be activated for its effect to be shown. Do this by either

- checking the box at an item in the object tree,
- use menu items such as _Objects &rarr; Activate all objects_,
- in an editor's context menu use items like _Activate the Objects contained in selection_ or (un)check the boxes listed for every object set for a selection.

### How do I apply an object to a text?

There are different ways to do this having selected some text:

- Drag and drop the editor selection to an item in the object tree. This works no matter if the object is activated or not.
- Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Set object(s)_ to add all activated objects to the selection. If no object is activated this has no effect.
- Use _Set activated object/s_ in an editor's context menu to add all activated objects to the selection..

### How do I remove an object from a text?

Having selected some text, you can

- Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Unset object(s)_ to remove all activated objects from the selection.
- Use menu item _Editor &rarr; Remove all objects_ to remove all objects (activated or not) from the selection.
- In an editor's context menu use _Unset activated object/s_ to remove all activated objects from the selection.
- In an editor's context menu use _Remove all object/s in Selection_ to remove all objects from the selection.
- In an editor's context menu use _Remove "xyz"_ to remove object _xyz_ from the selection.

### How do I find specific objects?

Use menu item _Objects &rarr; Search_ to open a window where you can search through various aspects of all objects to find all matching ones. In the result list you can open the properties of a listed object and (de)activate it.

### How do I highlight the text passages in the editor an object is connected with?

To see an object's effect in the editor you must activate it. Click the checkbox of an item in the object tree. All text passages connected to the object are formatted in the object's style. If you activate more than one object the last activated object will get precedence on overlapping text passages.

To avoid any overlapping issues you can configure single selection mode by using menu item _Objects &rarr; Single select mode_.

As an alternative to showing relevant text passages in the full object's style you can switch to highlight mode by clicking on the "A"-symbol in the editor's status bar. In this mode the text not connected to an activated object is shown less opaque -- how much so can be adjusted between 0% (totally invisible) and 100% (fully visible and thus indistinguishable from the object related passages) using the slider next to the "A"-symbol.

### Can I reuse the objects of some other project?

Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the _Imports_ section.
